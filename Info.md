# Duff's Custom Bots Plans

## Info
Hey! I'm Duff. I code JS Discord Bots for all kinds of servers. I used to have a 2.5K community server with a custom made bot which did litterly everything in it! I've basicly coded anything but I'm open to new challenges!

## Requirements
- Must have 50 members
- Must use PayPal
- Must be respectful, coding takes time

# Plans

## Free
This is a basic bot which does ping, help, poll, avatar and rps. This is a simple bot which I can get online for you within a day!

## Paid
This plan starts from the Free plan, all those things will be in the bot when it goes online. 

### Hosting
I rent a virtual server from a hosting company, which requires me to pay for it. This is way I ask a basic fee monthly for 1â‚¬. This will also be the basic price if you don't ask for new things to be added to the bot... 

### List of systems
The price of these systems/commands will be discussed in private DM's. Keep in mind that those which require the most time (Custom leveling system) will be more expensive then for example (moderation)
